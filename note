a few js
one object on js file
main put last on the script


1. set window request abumframe - called 60 times per sec
2. render function

have godmode...to bypass some feature to test for developers

game must be able to reset

1. create game function insiide have render()
create the properties put comments what is that property.properties has-errordefault
values
-you put settings object with all those settings inside since we may
have multiple players

wall switches boolean

- set world setting

render()
how many sec to restart the game
monster will respawn
go to IDE see it spawn...generating
it will pause when you go to another screen

initialise the Game object

when you call window function it is not called the right scope so
Jens fixed his cloud

init() to start the game

if you hit two keys at the same time...two event will fire
since its a different key

check setup event keyup work first or not..is it false for all keys..go to iDE console
then try if keydown work or Not

Ball Object
-------
bullets = []; //if you have bullets
objects gets the settings
create the element
create the init and render
create()
-create () add it to the game board
move(interactions)
-adjust positions


--in render() in margin
- dont forget the word function
loop through the assets and render each time ..
- make render in ball public then you can access it as a function on your margin


go to network under Preview
check ball i think

debug
ballelement.style.top  return Nan...top value is zero
go to css put this ball is

Y top
X Left

you are only moving the top left tip when you move

collision under move in ball
if settings. wall is true
you find the x left right since you need to check two wall
how to get width of the screen?
js ..got window function ..innerwidth and innder height

so first are we hitting the bottom so that we can say
y-bottom bigger than the height of the screen


(0 is always the top of the screen)

in move()
you are going to add so need to parse to integer
h-parseInt height subtract
note:   ballElement.getBoundingClientRect()
